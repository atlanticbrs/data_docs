# Atlantic BRS data documentation
This [manual](https://atlanticbrs.github.io/data_docs) is intended as a companion, explanation, and data dictionary for the [Atlantic BRS data portal](https://brsdataportalbeta.netlify.app). The information contained here is primarily intended for those who are actively working on the project and already have access to the data. For questions about obtaining access please contact (**brandon [dot] southall [at] sea-inc [dot] net**) directly. If this is not where you expected to be you might be looking for the [Atlantic BRS public website](https://brsmainpagebeta.netlify.app)?

For questions or problems with this manual or if you are interested in contributing directly please email **wrc14 [at] duke [dot] edu**.

## This is a draft; contributions welcome

This is a work in progress and currently a very early draft (in January 2021). Please if you notice mistakes or have ideas for additions you are welcome to contribute.

You can email **wrc14 [at] duke [dot] edu** for access if you don't already have it and would like to contribute directly on github via pull request. If you don't want to use github you can also email comments and additions as text, markdown, or rmarkdown files.
