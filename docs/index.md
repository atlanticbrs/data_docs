This manual is intended as a companion, explanation, and data dictionary for the [Atlantic BRS data portal](https://brsdataportalbeta.netlify.app).

For questions about obtaining access please contact (**brandon [dot] southall [at] sea-inc [dot] net**) directly. If this is not where you expected to be you might be looking for the [Atlantic BRS public website](https://brsmainpagebeta.netlify.app)?
