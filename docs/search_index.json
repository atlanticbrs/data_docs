This is currently empty. 4.3 Bench test pre-field This is for tests conducted generally at DUML but before any deployment on a tag to test that the tag is functioning. These tests might include: Salt water switch activation Hydrophone recording test Voltage and resistance test of burn Spin tests of all three axes VHF test and initial tuning There should be one directory per tag including at least a DTG and a README explaining tests. DTAG calibration datasheet This is a worksheet / checklist for predeployment tests borrowed for JS and the VA Beach Humpback field effort. cols: Each column represents a pre-field (or pre-expedition) checklist for a single tag. A new column should be made for each check even if it is the same tag from a previous year. rows: Tag# this is a short name using in the form D### for the tag Date the date of the checklist Tag ID this is an actual serial number for the tag and tends to be 8 digits Frequency this is the nominal frequency of the tag and should be printed on the tag somewhere. Tuned frequency this is the tuned frequency used for testing. Each reciever will have to be individually tuned before deployments. Problems summary either Ready, pending, or failed Visual inspection a short description of the condition of the tag an x indicates good overall condition. D3host connection any notes on failures for connections or an x for good consistent connections. firmawre the currently installed firmware version MSP fireware the currently installed firmware version Acoustic sampling Battery voltage LED lights SWS Configuration an x indicates complete Arm an x indicates complete Triger an x indicates complete VHF Beacon an x indicates functioning Release voltage L+R Voltage separated by a comma during a burn test. Programmed release an x indicates functioning Sensor sample rate in Hz Flip test Flipping over each axis. an `x indicates complete and approved (by looking at the resultant data) Rotation test rotating around the cardinal directions. an x indicates complete and approved (by looking at the resultant data) notes any additional notes hydrophone tap test an x indicates approved (by listening/inspecting the resultant wav files) reflective tap an x indicates present. cell phone number an x indicates present. radio frequency tuning an x indicates complete. Float test yes or no and an indication if it was completed in fresh or salt water separated by comma. Cup attachment test an x indicates complete and successful. Cal file an x indicates in possession and archived. Battery voltage (target: around 3-4.2)** Thermistor voltage (target: around 1) PB+ voltage (around 2.1) PB- Voltage (around 0.12) Pressure voltage (around 0.1, no spikes) External Voltage (if in use) Mz voltage (around 1) Magnetometer voltage (self-calibration signal in start) MB+ Voltage (around 1.05 for Hurst tags) MB- voltage (around 0.12) Mtst0mV voltage (around 1) Mtst3mV voltage (around 0.4) Magnetometer preamp gain (around 194) MAG CAL (x,y,z) (around 1+/- 0.03) MAG CAL residual (2-4%) Balance ACC CAL (x,y,z) (around 5 and -2.5) ACC CAL residual Balance Author 4.4 Pre-deploy setup There are two main items in this directory: 1. A prep worksheet based on the VA beach field effort courtesy of JS. 2. A summary of the D3host settings used prior to any DTAG deployment. Currently these are screenshots. These can be transcribed to a metadata sheet in the future, retaining the screenshot as an audit. DTAG3 pre worksheet Currently this is not updated but serves as a checklist of checks prior to any DTAG deployment. 4.5 Calibration files These are manufacter supplied calibration files neccessary for processing DTAG data. filenames tend to be in the format dx###.xml. Note that these are separate from the cal files which are created during the prh processing. These files can be found in dtag_data under the individual tags. notes The ID in dx312 does not match what d3read reports for the physical tag. In the xml: e3232f17, in d3read: 71232222. 4.6 dtag_data There should be one directory per recovered DTAG. There are two types of directories here: (1) boat_deployments which were deployed near the surtface from a boat to record RLs during a CEE. Each directory represents a recording sequence and should be in the format [YYYYMMDD]_CEE_[SOURCE PLATFORM]_RLs and (2) animal_deployments which are standard dtag deployments on animals and should be in the format [Sp][YY]_[JULIANDAY][a, b, c, ...]. Within each directory there can be the following files and directories: Setup file descriptions or screenshot Post-deployment datasheet Offload audit (usually a screenshot) dtg a directory containing the raw dtgs offloaded from the tag unpacked a directory containing the unpacked dtgs which consist of one of the following for each dtg *.svw sensor data file *.wav audio file *.xml metadata file processed which can contain the following prh pitch roll heading and depth sensor file processed to the whale frame cal cal file created during prh processing containing metadata a script detailing the prh creation process pseudo track RL (in the case of a CEE) notes There appear to be multiple errors in the prh files due to either tag errors, slides, or frame errors in processing. Use with caution for now. Several tags may have suffered catastrophic failurews Gm17_234a there appears to be a missing DTG #6. There is a #6 swv and xml in the unpacked directory but no dtg or wav. Likely this is after recovery? One of the boat_recordings is not a dtag but a record from a SNAP. gm18_159b appears to have a serious sensor failure gm17_234a is not in the whale frame gm18_157a is not in the whale frame gm18_157b roll is off does not account for tag move in 2nd dive gm18_239a pitch is off at the surface zc17_234a, zc19_234a unknown status zc20_231a catastrophic failure? zc20_232a heading looks off "]]
